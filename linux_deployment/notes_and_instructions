Deploying and provisioning the Working Linux Environment on your Windows Laptops"

VirtualBox is a virtualization software that facilitates working with another operating system when the computer is booted to one. The operating system environment that VirtualBox is running is called a Virtual Machine (VM). So the other operating system will just be working as a program.

- The operating system that the computer is running on is called "Host"
- The operating system that the Virtual Machine is running is called "Guest"
- In our example our Host will be Windows (or Mac OS X) and Guest will be Linux (Ubuntu Linux)

Vagrant is a deployment/provisioning program that facilitates creating, configuring and managing a VM. Vagrant boils all these tasks down to just a single command like "vagrant up" or "vagrant provision"!!!!



Before starting:
- Learn how to enter the setup many of your computer. Ä±t depends on the make and model but mostly you should hit a function key such as F5, F8, F10, F12 or Del key when the computer first powers on.
- Browse the setup menu, and enable any hardware virtualization (VT-x) related options

After windows is booted
- Type "windows features" on the search bar, and find:

Programs and Features > Turn Windows Features on or off

There, you should find "Hyper-V" and uninstall that feature completely if it is enabled (This is recommended since Hyper-V may block VT-x which is important for running Virtualbox)


Basic installation:

#Installing VirtualBox
- Visit VirtualBox website.

https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

There, select the appropriate download for your OS, download and install

Then install the Extension Pack, link of which is just below the download links for the program
(VirtualBox _._._ Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack  All supported platforms)
(Every few weeks a new version is released, so I kept the version info empty)

# Installing Vagrant
- Visit the Vagrant webpage:

https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

- And download and install the appropriate version for your OS.

# Installing necessary plugins for vagrant:
- Type "cmd" on windows search and open the command prompt
- Copy and run these lines:

vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater
vagrant plugin install vagrant-disksize
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

- These plugins are necessary for the sunbsequent deployment/provisioning


Before provisioning:
- Download the Vargrantfile in this repository
- Create a new directory that is at a preferably convenient path (like Desktop, etc) (e.g. "bda505" on Desktop)
- Put that Vagrantfile in this directory
- Now open the Vagrantfile with a text editor you would like. It is just a simple text document

Change the values in following lines to your liking:

- config.disksize.size: This is the size of the virtual hard disk file that your Linux environment will run on. It is recommended that, you should keep this one at least 100 GB, since we will be working with big data. You can change the size whenever you want, and when the VM is invoked from Vagrant, the disk size will be automatically changed (preferably increased, not decreased)

- vb.memory: The portion of the overall RAM of your computer dedicated to your VM. It should not be below 5 gb so that our programs work properly, if you have 8 GB of RAM. If you have 16 GB or more, let the VM use at least 10 GB of memory so that it runs faster.

- vb.cpus: Number of cores dedicated to your VM. If your PC is quadcore (4 cores), dedicate 2 or 3 cores to your VM. If it is octacore (8 cores), dedicate at least 4.

- config.vm.synced_folder "/host_path_to_shared_directory", "/guest_path_to_shared_directory": The path to the shared directory. With this directory it is easier to swap data between the host and the guest (both can access the same directory contents). Note that you should create the host directory before you invoke ths Vagrantfile otherwise it will throw an error

Note that, apart from the shared folder you are configuring the directory where Vagrantfile resides is also mapped to the "/vagrant" directory of the guest




Provisioning:
- Check that no other unnecessary process/program is running on Windows
- Check that you have a working internet connection

- Open a command prompt (cmd) and navigate to the directory that Vagrantfile resides
(The default working directory is the User Home. So navigating to C:/Users/Your_User_Name/Desktop/bda505 is:
cd Desktop/bda505

- Just type the following command, and Vagrant will do the rest!! Note that you should be in the directory where Vagrantfile resides!!!

vagrant up

- In subsequent runs, if you have changed any provisioning commands (such as installing a new program on the guest, etc), after vagrant up finishes just type (again when the working directory on cmd is where the Vagrantfile resides) :

vagrant provision

- If you want to shutdown the virtual machine, just type:

vagrant halt

- If you want ssh into a running VM:

vagrant ssh


IF YOU WANT TO DELETE THE VM COMPLETELY (THINK TWICE BEFORE HITTING THIS COMMAND!!!):

vagrant destroy




You can bi-directionally share the clipboard (for copy/cut/paste) and drag-and-drop between host and guest. You can use the shared directories to transfer data and files between the host and the guest. And the guest can detect and mount usb drives (but not that if the Windows host first mounts the drive, first it should be unmounted from the host)
