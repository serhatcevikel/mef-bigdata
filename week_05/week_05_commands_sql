# Return all the fields from title_basics and "averagerating" field from title_ratings of the "movies" that Al Pacino took role in
# Exclude titles which have no "averagerating" info (with "IS NOT NULL" logical test)

# Note that: In order to get the id of Al Pacino, from the name_basics table, you should check the "primaryname" field for equality with "Al Pacino" and birthyear with "1940"  
# You can use multiple "common table expressions" (CTE) or "WITH" queries to simplify the main query
# You can use aliases for tables to simplify your query (e.g. FROM title_basics tb)
